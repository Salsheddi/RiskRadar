RiskRadar

Overview

RiskRadar is an advanced system designed to enhance safety on construction sites by automating the monitoring of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) compliance. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, RiskRadar ensures that workers adhere to safety protocols, thereby reducing the risk of accidents and injuries.

Motivation

Construction sites are among the most hazardous work environments, with a significant risk of accidents and injuries due to falling objects, machinery, and other dangers. Ensuring that workers adhere to safety protocols by wearing appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as helmets, gloves, safety vests, and goggles is crucial for mitigating these risks.

However, traditional methods of monitoring PPE compliance often rely on manual inspections, which can be inconsistent and labor-intensive. There is a pressing need for automated systems that can efficiently and accurately monitor PPE usage in real time to enhance safety and ensure regulatory compliance. RiskRadar addresses this need by providing a reliable, automated solution.
